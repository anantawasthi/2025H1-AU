### ðŸ“˜ **Career Growth Timeline for an Individual Contributor in Data Science**

As organizations become increasingly data-driven, the role of a Data Scientist has evolved from just modeling to solving complex business problems through end-to-end analytics. While many data professionals take the managerial path, a significant number choose to grow as Individual Contributors (ICs), focusing on deep technical expertise and thought leadership. This path allows professionals to make high-impact contributions without the responsibilities of people management. Below is a detailed career timeline for a Data Scientist who chooses the IC track, showing how designations, responsibilities, and skillsets evolve over time.
