### **What is Data Science?**

*Data Science is the art of turning raw data into useful stories and smart decisions.*

Just like a chef turns ingredients into delicious meals, a data scientist takes numbers, facts, and figures—and cooks up insights that help businesses solve problems, plan better, and serve people smarter. It’s a mix of common sense, curiosity, and computer help to understand what’s happening, why it’s happening, and what could happen next.

| **Cooking**                  | **Data Science**                              |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Ingredients                  | Raw Data (sales numbers, customer info, etc.) |
| Recipe                       | Algorithm (set of steps to solve a problem)   |
| Chef                         | Data Scientist                                |
| Kitchen Tools (knife, stove) | Tools (Excel, Python, Power BI)               |
| Taste Testing                | Data Validation / Testing                     |
| Final Dish                   | Insight or Prediction                         |


“Imagine you're a chef in a kitchen. You’ve got vegetables, spices, and sauces. But unless you know how to mix them right and use your tools, you won’t get a good meal. That’s exactly what Data Science does—except with data. We use tools, follow smart steps, and test along the way until we cook up insights that help make better decisions.”

### **Data Science (as a discipline)**

*Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines techniques from statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights and patterns from structured and unstructured data.*

It involves the entire lifecycle of working with data—including data collection, cleaning, exploration, modeling, interpretation, and communication—to support decision-making, automate processes, or enable predictive and prescriptive analytics.

At its core, Data Science blends:

- **Mathematics & Statistics** – for quantifying uncertainty and making inferences

- **Computer Science & Programming** – for building tools, pipelines, and algorithms

- **Domain Expertise** – to ensure relevance and actionability of results

It is foundational to modern technologies such as machine learning, AI, business intelligence, and data-driven decision systems.

### **A Good Data Scientist**

> A person who can translate business problems to data science problem statement, translate data science statement to a data science solution, build the data science solution (efficiently), collate the results, translate the results into action items, and communicate the action items and results to business stakeholders.



**A Data Scientist expected to be expert of:**

Statistics, programming, data management, story telling (sometime referred as data visualization), and stakeholder communication
