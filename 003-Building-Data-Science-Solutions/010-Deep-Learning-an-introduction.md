### **What is Deep Learning?**

**Deep Learning** is a specialized branch of Machine Learning that uses **artificial neural networks** to mimic how the human brain processes information. These networks are made up of multiple layers ‚Äî hence the term *"deep."*

Deep Learning excels at solving problems where traditional Machine Learning struggles, especially when the data is **large, complex, and unstructured** ‚Äî such as **images, audio, video, and natural language**.
