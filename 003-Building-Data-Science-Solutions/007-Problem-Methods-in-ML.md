## 🤖 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can **learn from data**, **identify patterns**, and **make decisions** with minimal human intervention.

Rather than being **explicitly programmed** for every task, a machine learning system **learns rules and relationships** from examples (data), and uses those to **predict outcomes** or **classify inputs**.

---

## 🧠 How It Works – In Simple Steps:

1. **Input Data**
   
   - Raw data like images, numbers, text, or transactions.

2. **Learning Process**
   
   - Algorithms find patterns or relationships in the data.

3. **Model Building**
   
   - A model is created that captures these patterns.

4. **Prediction/Inference**
   
   - The model is used to make predictions on new data.

## 🧩 Types of Machine Learning:

| Type              | Description                               | Example                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Supervised**    | Learn from labeled data                   | Email spam classification |
| **Unsupervised**  | Find patterns in unlabeled data           | Customer segmentation     |
| **Reinforcement** | Learn from feedback (rewards/punishments) | Self-driving cars         |
