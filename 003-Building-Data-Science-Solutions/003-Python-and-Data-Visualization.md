  - 🧱 **Weakness**: Verbose syntax.

🔸 *Example:* Creating a simple line chart from scratch.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.title("Simple Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.show()
```

---

### 🔹 2. **Mid-Level Libraries (Simplified Layer)**

These are built on top of Matplotlib or similar engines and **simplify common tasks**.

- **Seaborn**
  
  - Built on Matplotlib. Adds statistical capabilities.

  - 🌟 **Strength**: Clean visuals with fewer lines of code.

- **Pandas Built-in Plotting**
  
  - Pandas DataFrames have `.plot()` method.
  
  - Perfect for quick insights during EDA.

🔸 *Example:* Quick histogram from a DataFrame:

```python
df['age'].plot(kind='hist', bins=10, title='Age Distribution')
```

---

### 🔹 3. **High-Level Libraries (Declarative & Interactive Layer)**

These libraries are meant for **interactive visualizations**, ideal for web and dashboards.

- **Plotly**
  
  - Interactive charts (zoom, pan, tooltip) by default.
  
  - Useful in notebooks, reports, dashboards.

- **Altair**
  
  - Declarative syntax (you tell what you want, not how).
  
  - Great for creating layered, beautiful charts with minimal effort.

- **Bokeh**
  
  - Best for dashboards and web apps.
  
  - Integrates well with Flask, Django, or standalone web pages.

---
